            <p>a.) In lieu of there not being a computer science program at EHHS, describe a project youâ€™ve worked on to learn (or teach yourself) more about technology? [My personal favorite was figuring out how to hypothetically hide a folder full of networked games on the school network so my graduating class had something to do during study halls!</p>

              <textarea rows="3" cols="55" name="project" required></textarea>
