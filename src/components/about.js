          <p>I wouldn't be able to enjoy my career as a DevOps Engineer now if it weren't for the unending support of some teachers that shaped my time at EHHS:</p>
          <p>Bill Gusky let me know freshman year that there's a place in the world for digital creatives of all mediums.</p>
          <p>Kristen Dean helped me set up an independent study to learn basic web development and also sparked an interest in learning about the business side of the web.</p>
          <p>James Angelo had electronics and robotics electives ready for me to dive into from the time I started high school. His tech ed room was open to me for the remainder of my time there to tinker with Lego robots, experiment with different Linux distributions, and work on whatever technical project I was trying to learn about that week.</p>
          <p>Their encouragement to pursue my passions beyond the offered curriclum at EHHS has undoubtedly helped me land on my feet as an adult, and I want to pay that support forward.</p>
          <p>Based on the number of classmates I've stayed in contact with over the years who work in tech despite the available course offerings, I know there have to be students at EHHS who are still putting in the extra hours to get themselves ready for college and a future career.</p>
          <p>They're the reason I'm starting The Henry Quinn Tech Enthusiast Scholarship. I'm honored to be able to help some students purchase textbooks, software, supplies, or whatever else they need to succeed in their next adventure.</p>
          <p>Hopefully somewhere down the line, I can grow this into something more. But until that day comes, I'll do right by those who helped prepare me for life after high school by helping those who are getting ready to move on to bigger things.</p>
