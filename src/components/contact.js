          <h3>Henry Quinn Tech Enthusiast Scholarship</h3>
          <p>Through the support and encouragement of some teachers here, I spent my high school years taking independent studies and continuing adult education classes in order to learn how to build websites and fix computers. After graduating college and landing a fun tech job, I want to pay it forward.</p>
          <p>This is for the new group of students messing with computers, setting up game servers for their friends, exploring networks they come across, and learning through experimentation.</p>
          <p>This scholarship awards $500 to two East Hampton High School seniors who intend to major (or otherwise continue their education in) in computer science or a related field of study. Please return your application to the Guidance Office by <strong>March 27th, 2020.</strong></p>
          <u>Please attach a word-processed response with the following information:</u>
          <ol>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Where do you plan on going to school? (College name, city and state)</li>
            <li>Short Questions - Just a few sentences for each:
              <p>What do you want to major in?</p>
              <p>Any ideas what you want to do for a career yet?</p>
              <p>Were there any life experiences, interests, or activities that got you interested in working with technology?</p>
            </li>
            <li>Short Essays - No more than 300 words for each:

              <p>In lieu of there not being a computer science program at EHHS, describe a project youâ€™ve worked on to learn (or teach yourself) more about technology? [My personal favorite was figuring out how to hypothetically hide a folder full of networked games on the school network so my graduating class had something to do during study halls!]</p>
            
            <p>Describe a piece of new technology (whether it be an app, a robot, or some kind of gadget) that you want to help create someday.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
